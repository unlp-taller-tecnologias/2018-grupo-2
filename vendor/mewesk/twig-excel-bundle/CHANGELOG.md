## 2.1 (2016-10-09)

**Fixes**

 * Bugfix #8 {% xlsmacro %} cannot call a macro defined in the same twig file (ThmX)
 * Fixed issue #14 'Include another template' (plfort)
 * Fixed issue #16 'Leading zeros problem in a string that contains an integer' (aserratorta)
 
**Features**

 * Added support for cell merging (malheirosrafa)
 * Added 'autoFilter' property to the 'xlssheet' tag (fdicioccio)
 * Added new 'xlsinclude' tag to support includes containing other TwigExcelBundle tags. Not the most elegant solution but necessary to clean up the node tree before including it in the main template.

## 2.0 (2016-02-27)

**Attention**

Some mayor changes required to increase the minimum requirements significantly. Therefore I'm bumping the version to 2.0.

**Improvements**

 * Converted help to RST-format and moved it to Resources/doc
 * Rendered version of the documentation is now hosted on readthedocs.org
 * Removed more deprecated function calls (for compatibility with Twig 2.0)
 * Removed unnecessary mock objects
 * Added messages to InvalidArgumentExceptions (darookee)
  
**Features**

 * Added support for blocks and macros in form of the new xlsblock/xlsmacro tags. The standard tags do sadly not work since they won't allow to alter the internal node structure.
 * Added support for document templates. Use existing spreadsheet files as templates.

## 1.2 (2015-12-02)

**Fixes**

 * Added Symfony 2.7 and 2.8 to the automated tests

**Improvements**

 * Added Symfony 3 support
 * Added PHP 7 automated tests

## 1.1 (2015-12-02)

**Fixes**

 * Fixed minimum PHP version to >=5.4 (short array syntax)
 * Fixed .PDF support
  
**Features**

 * Added .ODS to the supported formats
 * Added 'dataType' property to the 'xlscell' tag. Used to manually override data type of the cell.
 * Added bundle config 'mewesk_twig_excel.pre_calculate_formulas'. Pre-calculating formulas can be slow in certain cases. Disabling this option can improve the performance but the resulting documents won't show the result of any formulas when opened in a external spreadsheet software.
 * Added bundle config 'mewesk_twig_excel.disk_caching_directory'. Using disk caching can improve memory consumption by writing data to disk temporarily. Works only for .XLSX and .ODS documents.

**Improvements**

 * Updated to latest stable PHPExcel
 * Updated to latest stable mPDF
 * Improved inline documentation
 * Improved code quality
 * Added latest PHP/HHVM and Symfony versions to the automated tests
 * Added more unit tests and functional tests

## 1.0 (2014-03-04)

 * Initial release
